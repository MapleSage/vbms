Van Booking & Fleet Management System (VBMS)

1. Background & Context

The company operates a shared fleet of vans used by 8 field Project Representatives throughout the year. Today, van bookings are managed via Excel, which introduces risks around multi-user conflicts, versioning, lack of audit trail, and accountability (fines, billing, usage tracking).

With Microsoft 365 already in use, the goal is to modernize this into a simple, user-friendly, SharePoint-based system while preserving Excel familiarity for analysis and reporting.

This system conceptually mirrors ride‑share / airline booking architectures, but implemented using Microsoft-native, low-code services.
